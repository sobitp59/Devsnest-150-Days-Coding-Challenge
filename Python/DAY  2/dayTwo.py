I referred this blog to dive deep in this topic : https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/understanding-mutable-and-immutable-in-python/#M&I

:: LISTS ARE MUTABLE
programmingLanguages = ['Python', 'JavaScript', 'Java ']
for programmingLanguage in programmingLanguages:
    print(programmingLanguage, end=' ')
print(hex(id(programmingLanguages)))

programmingLanguages.append('C++')
for programmingLanguage in programmingLanguages:
    print(programmingLanguage, end=' ')
print(hex(id(programmingLanguages)))

# ids are same before and after which means it doesn't form a new list and hence it is mutable


:: STRINGS ARE IMMUTABLE

name = 'Sobit'
print(name, hex(id(name)))

x = name.replace('Sobit', 'Rohit')
print(x, hex(id(x)))
